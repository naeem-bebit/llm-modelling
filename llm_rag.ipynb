       "[Document(page_content=\"Anwar bin Ibrahim (Jawi: Ø§Ù†ÙˆØ± Ø¨Ù† Ø§Ø¨Ø±Ø§Ù‡ÙŠÙ… IPA: [anwar Éªbrah Éªm]; born 10 August 1947) is a Malaysian \\npolitician who has served as the tenth Prime Minister of Malaysia since 2022.  He served as the 12th and \\n16th Leader of the Opposition from 2008 to 2015 and again from 2020 to 2022. He has been the \\nchairman of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition since 2020, the second President of the People's Justice \\nParty (PKR) since 2018 and the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tambun since November 2022. He also \\nserved as Deputy Prime Minister and in many other Cabinet positions in the Barisan Nasional (BN) \\nadministration under former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad from 1982 to his removal in 1998.  \\n \\nA graduate of the University of Malaya, Anwar started his political career as President of student union \\nPersatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar Islam Malaysia (PKPIM) and one of the founders and 2nd President of \\nyouth organisation Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM).  After joining the United Malays National \\nOrganisation (UMNO), the major party in the long -time ruling BN coalition, Anwar held several cabinet \\npositions in successive governments in the 1980s and 1990s. He was deputy prime minister and Finance \\nMinister during the 1990s and was prominent in Malaysia's response to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[6] \\nIn 1998, he was removed from all posts by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and went on to \\nspearhead the Reformasi movement against the government. Anwar was jailed in April 1999,[7] until his \\nrelease in 2004 after his conviction was overturned. He made a comeback as Leader of the Opposition \\nfrom 2008 to 2015 and coalesced opposition parties into the Pakatan Rakyat (PR) coalition, which \\nunsuccessfully contested in the 2008 and 2013 general elections. He disputed the results of the 2013 \\nelections and led a protest in response.  \\n \\nIn 2014, Anwar's attempt to become Selangor head of government in the 2014 Kajang Move led to a \\nnine -month political crisis, which ended when he was sentenced to another extensive five years \\nimprisonment after a second sodomy conviction in 2015.[8] While still in prison, Anwar re -joined \\nMahathir Mohamad in the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition in absentia, which went on to win the \\n2018 general election. Mahathir outlined a plan for Anwar to take over from himself as prime minister \\nafter an unspecified interim period.[9] Anwar received a royal pardon from Yang di -Pertuan Agong \\nMuhammad V[10] and was released from prison in May 2018.[11][12] He returned to parliament in the \\n2018 Port Dickson by -election while his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail served as the Deputy Prime Minister \\nin the PH administration. The collapse of the coalition during the 2020 â€“22 Malaysian political crisis led to \\nthe new Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition under Muhyiddin Yassin being sworn in and Anwar becoming \\nLeader of the Opposition for the second time in May 2020.  \\n \\nAfter leading Pakatan Harapan to win a plurality of seats at the 2022 Malaysian general election, Anwar \\nwas sworn in as the tenth Prime Minister of Malaysia on 24 November 2022.[13] On 2 December 2022, \\nAnwar appointed various members of Parliament from Pakatan Harapan, Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), \\nand UMNO to serve as ministers in the cabinet of the newly formed unity government. Anwar named \\nhimself as the Finance Minister.[14] During his tenure, he and his government faced criticism for \\nimplementing numer ous conservative policies, as well as the discharge not amounting to the acquittal of \\ncurrent Malaysian deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who faced corruption charges.[15]\", metadata={'source': 'pm_my.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Anwar bin Ibrahim (Jawi: Ø§Ù†ÙˆØ± Ø¨Ù† Ø§Ø¨Ø±Ø§Ù‡ÙŠÙ… IPA: [anwar Éªbrah Éªm]; born 10 August 1947) is a Malaysian \\npolitician who has served as the tenth Prime Minister of Malaysia since 2022.  He served as the 12th and \\n16th Leader of the Opposition from 2008 to 2015 and again from 2020 to 2022. He has been the \\nchairman of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition since 2020, the second President of the People's Justice \\nParty (PKR) since 2018 and the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tambun since November 2022. He also \\nserved as Deputy Prime Minister and in many other Cabinet positions in the Barisan Nasional (BN) \\nadministration under former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad from 1982 to his removal in 1998.  \\n \\nA graduate of the University of Malaya, Anwar started his political career as President of student union \\nPersatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar Islam Malaysia (PKPIM) and one of the founders and 2nd President of \\nyouth organisation Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM).  After joining the United Malays National \\nOrganisation (UMNO), the major party in the long -time ruling BN coalition, Anwar held several cabinet \\npositions in successive governments in the 1980s and 1990s. He was deputy prime minister and Finance \\nMinister during the 1990s and was prominent in Malaysia's response to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[6] \\nIn 1998, he was removed from all posts by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and went on to \\nspearhead the Reformasi movement against the government. Anwar was jailed in April 1999,[7] until his \\nrelease in 2004 after his conviction was overturned. He made a comeback as Leader of the Opposition \\nfrom 2008 to 2015 and coalesced opposition parties into the Pakatan Rakyat (PR) coalition, which \\nunsuccessfully contested in the 2008 and 2013 general elections. He disputed the results of the 2013 \\nelections and led a protest in response.  \\n \\nIn 2014, Anwar's attempt to become Selangor head of government in the 2014 Kajang Move led to a \\nnine -month political crisis, which ended when he was sentenced to another extensive five years \\nimprisonment after a second sodomy conviction in 2015.[8] While still in prison, Anwar re -joined \\nMahathir Mohamad in the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition in absentia, which went on to win the \\n2018 general election. Mahathir outlined a plan for Anwar to take over from himself as prime minister \\nafter an unspecified interim period.[9] Anwar received a royal pardon from Yang di -Pertuan Agong \\nMuhammad V[10] and was released from prison in May 2018.[11][12] He returned to parliament in the \\n2018 Port Dickson by -election while his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail served as the Deputy Prime Minister \\nin the PH administration. The collapse of the coalition during the 2020 â€“22 Malaysian political crisis led to \\nthe new Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition under Muhyiddin Yassin being sworn in and Anwar becoming \\nLeader of the Opposition for the second time in May 2020.  \\n \\nAfter leading Pakatan Harapan to win a plurality of seats at the 2022 Malaysian general election, Anwar \\nwas sworn in as the tenth Prime Minister of Malaysia on 24 November 2022.[13] On 2 December 2022, \\nAnwar appointed various members of Parliament from Pakatan Harapan, Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), \\nand UMNO to serve as ministers in the cabinet of the newly formed unity government.
